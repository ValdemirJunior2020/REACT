Lesson 10 Final Project200 points
Directions
Welcome to the Final Project for the React course! Great job making it this far! This Final Project will be different from the Hands-On projects you have previously seen in a couple of different ways. For the Final Project, you will be putting together the numerous topics you have learned into one large project. It is designed to mimic real problems which you may face in your career, so it may be a challenge for you and will also take several hours. Take this project step-by-step and be aware that the project description below is written to be a bit less specific than previous Hands-Ons. The Final Project is supposed to challenge you to do some problem solving to figure out how to accomplish a task. You can always review past lessons or use a Google search if needed. Good luck!

Caution!
Do not submit your project until you have completed all requirements! You will not be able to resubmit.

Setup
For this project, you will be working with the React/Redux counter you created in Lesson 8.

Download this counter starter project here, add it to your FEFReact directory and rename it to be L10HandsOn.
Once the project has downloaded, don't forget to run npm install.
This counter project is structured differently than how you built it in the lesson, but does the exact same thing.
This project includes the separate folders and files for the actions, components and reducers.
You will be adding more functionality to this project, as you will see from the below requirements.
Requirements
Step 1
Remove the Reset button and its functionality.

Step 2
Add the functionality which counts the number of clicks made to both the increment and decrement buttons. - This number should show on the page with a label.

Step 3
Add an input field where the user can input a number. Next to the input should be a button. When the button is clicked, the original increment and decrement count should reset to the number that was inputted and the number of clicks should reset to zero. - The number should not add onto the number that was created by clicking the increment and decrement buttons. The number listed should show the exact number inputted.

Step 4
Your project should end up looking similar to the example below. - Based on the above image, when the Change Count Number button is clicked, the number 4 will be replaced with 33 and the number 12 will be replaced with 0.
